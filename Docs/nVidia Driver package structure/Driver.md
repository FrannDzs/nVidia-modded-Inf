This document basically explains the nVidia Driver package structure, you might ask yourself why this is important? This matter in case you want to re-pack and understand which components are removable and which components are absolutely necessary for a guaranteed minimum "[crap-free](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/nVidia-modded-Inf/tree/master/Telemetry)" (debloat) nVidia package.

Removable: The folder should never never be removed.


## Display.NView

[nView Desktop Management Software](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/solutions/nview-display/) provides support for multi-monitor setups which basically [tells Windows how to deal with multiple monitors](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3052/~/nview-desktop-manager-software-users-guide). NView is deprecated. 


Removable: Yes, unless you need & use NView.


## Display.Optimus

[Optimus](https://www.nvidia.com/object/optimus_technology.html) and original designed to power manage your notebook (provides profiles etc).


Removable: Yes (_optional_), unless you need & use Optimus.


## Display.Update

The folder contains the `Update.Core` service which is used to update your graphic driver in case a new release is avbl. It's also used by GFE in order to notify you about the update itself. This is optional.


Removable: Yes (_optional_), unless you need & use Optimus.


## GFExperience

[GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) (GFE) will be installed by default. 


Removable: Yes (_optional_), unless you need & use GFE.


## GFExperience.NvStreamSrv

The streaming service is same as GFE itself _optional_, the folder itself holds the server files which are created by [ShadowPlay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) to start and stop the recording & streaming.


Removable: Yes (_optional_), unless you need & use GFE.


## HDAudio

This is _optional_, the folder includes the driver files for [nVidia's HD Audio](https://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_27962.html) which is required in case you use HDMI/Audio output directly from/to your monitor(s). Some features explicitly need the driver or checking if the driver is installed but in normal situations it's not required to install the driver. 

The Microsoft Windows own included driver already offers some basic functionality which might cover the needs of some people e.g. get sound on your TV speakers or headphones connected to your TV however, the nVidia sound driver offers more features e.g. additional PCM and pass-through formats including multi-channel hi-res formats for some AVRs.


Removable: Yes (_semi-optional), unless you need & use nVidia's HD Audio over a HDMI connection. In the `repack` versions the nVidia HD Audio driver is included, it doesn't waste much space on your HDD/SSD and you could manually enable/disable it whenever you need it, within the Windows Audio Manager or Device Manager.


## MSVCRT

[Microsoft Windows library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd758096(v=vs.85).aspx) (short: MSVCRT) folders contains the shared libraries which are required for several services like e.g. GFE, if you already have the MSVCRT installed you don't need them. 


Removable: Yes, unless you newly installed Microsoft Windows (which doesn't include the latest MSVCRT).


## NGXCore

[NVIDIA NGX Technology](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ngx) folder is optional and provides AI-based features that accelerate and enhance graphics, photos imaging and video processing directly into some applications. 


Removable: Yes, unless you really need and work with it, if you're unsure check the official [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/rtx/ngx/programming-guide/index.html).


## nodejs

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser, this is required for several functions like e.g. streaming, update checks etc. 


Removable: Yes, if you don't use GFE and other services you can remove the folder.


## NvAbHub

It's a plugin and optional. 


Removable: Yes, if you don't use.


## NvBackend

The nVidia Backend folder provides dll's for several functions, update check, battery checks & nVidia Control panel.


Removable: Yes (_optional_), if you don't use the updater utility you can remove it.


## NvCamera

Also known as [nVidia Ansel](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/ansel) is already deprecated and optional. Some games still use it so you can make the decision if you need it or not based on which games you have installed or you plan to install e.g. WatchDogs has nVidia Ansel support. Ansel itself is known to cause some FPS issues (if enabled) in several games and under several conditions.


Removable: Yes (_optional_), depends on which games you install. Ansel can be enabled/disabled globally or per-game basis.
 

## NvContainer

The [Container process](https://www.howtogeek.com/343120/what-are-all-those-nvidia-processes-running-in-the-background/) and service is optional but is required for several integrated functions like GFE (e.g. the Overlay) to function probably. 


Removable: Yes (_semi-optional_), depends on which services you use.


## NVI2

NVi2 provides parts of the setup installer code and should not be removed because you will not be able to install the driver without it.


Removable: The folder should never never be removed.


## NvTelemetry

Everyone's _necessary evil_, some people like it other want to get rid of it. The Telemetry folder is optional and can be removed. You should consider if you want to help nVidia to improve the driver to send feedback (it does not submits any private information). 


Removable: Yes.


## NvVAD

Contains a driver `NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible) (WDM)` and is optional, if you don't have/use it you can remove the folder.


Removable: Yes.


## NvvHCI

NVVHCI Enumerator (nVidia Virtual USB Host Controller driver) is an optional process and the folder can be removed. The service is only needed to get the USB-Port on your nVidia Shield device working. 


Removable: Yes.


## PhysX

NVidia's [PhysX](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/physx) is an open-source real-time physics engine middleware SDK developed as a part of nVidia GameWorks software suite.


Removable: Yes. But a lot of applications and games _might benefit_ from it.


## PPC

Similar to NvVAD, the folder [contains a USB-C HDMI Driver](https://sites.google.com/view/virtuallink-consortium/), in this case `NVIDIA USB Type-C Port Policy Controller` which is optional.


Removable: Yes.


## NVPCF 

This folder is only included in the Store versions, it doesn't include several exes and infs which are required for Windows internal driver installation routines.

Removable: No, not needed.


## NGX (NGXCore)

Removable: Yes, but normally not needed and included in the DHC package.


## ShadowPlay

The folder is optional and contains [ShadowPlay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) components. The service is depending on GFE and GFExperience.NvStreamSrv in order to record/stream your game. An open-source alternative to it is [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) which includes also the nVidia SDK to use nVidia NVENC (nVidia Encoder) which is similar to ShadowPlay.


Removable: Yes, is _needed_ for GFE & game recording/streaming.


## ShieldWirelessController

As the name already indicates, the folder contains the optional Wireless Controller driver.


Removable: Yes, if you don't need or use it you can simply remove the folder. 


## Update.Core

The folder is optional and only required in case you use the integrated driver update mechanism. 


Removable: Yes, if you don't need or use it you can simply remove the folder. 


## EULA.txt

[End-user license agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement) (EULA) file.


Removable: No, the `setup.exe` reads & needs the eula.


## license.txt

The [license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License) file.


Removable: No, the `setup.exe` reads & needs the eula.


## ListDevices.txt

The devices list is checked by the setup.exe to see if your hardware is compatible or not.


Removable: No, the `setup.exe` reads & needs the eula.


## setup.cfg

The setup.cfg basically tells the setup.exe what to look for and what to install. You theoretically can manipulate it to cheat around several limitations or to simply tell the setup to exclude several things from been installed. If you repack a driver you often see another file `setup.cfg.bak` which is the original (untouched) file.


Removable: No, the `setup.exe` reads & needs the eula.


## setup.exe

The Setup which is required to install the driver and it's components. `EULA.txt`, `license.txt`, `ListDevices.txt` & `setup.cfg` is required and should not be removed because the setup.exe checks it, without it the setup will not function properly. 


Removable: No.


## Display.Nview

This is the [NView desktop manager](http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?s=0810c64506081036f52ca974f03ead29&showtopic=102357&pid=605794&st=0&#entry605794).
